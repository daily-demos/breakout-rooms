## Getting Started

This demo requires a `private` Daily [room](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/rooms/config#privacy), this can be done via Daily's [REST API](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/rooms/create-room) or the [Daily dashboard](https://dashboard.daily.co/rooms/create)

1. Installing the dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. Setting up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Now, you can update your variables accordingly in `.env.local` file.

4. Running the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
